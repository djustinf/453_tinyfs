Our implementation:

Additional functionality:
    1. Directory listing and renaming: 
    
    2. Read-only and writeByte support:
    
    3. Timestamps: Bytes 18-42 are used to store three time_t values representing
    the creation time, last modified time, and last accessed time. tfs_readFileInfo
    will return the creation time of a given file.

    4. Fragmentation info and defragmentation: tfsDisplayFragments was implemented
    to display a visual representation of the file system. It simply loops through
    all of the memory all prints out a visual representation for every block.
