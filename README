Our implementation:

Additional functionality:
    1. Directory listing and renaming: 
    
    2. Read-only and writeByte support:
    
    3. Timestamps: Bytes 18-42 are used to store three time_t values representing
    the creation time, last modified time, and last accessed time. tfs_readFileInfo
    will return the creation time of a given file. We tested this functionality in
    the demo file by grabbing the time right before a file is created, then created
    the file, and then called tfs_readFileInfo on that file to retrieve the creation
    time. Our demo shows that both times match, as expected.

    4. Fragmentation info and defragmentation: tfs_displayFragments was implemented
    to display a visual representation of the file system. It simply loops through
    all of the memory all prints out a visual representation for every block. To
    test this, we call displayFragments after we've opened three files, and it
    correctly prints out the superblock, three inodes, and three file extents, 
    with the rest of the blocks being free.
